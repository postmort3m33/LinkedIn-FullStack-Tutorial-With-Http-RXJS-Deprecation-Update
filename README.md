This is a LinkedIn Full Stack Tutorial I did creating a Landon Hotel site with the ability to make get available reservations and make reservations. The angular front-end was originally done using the Http Module and and older version of RXJS. Going through the tutorial I was required to Refactor the project and utilize the new HTTPClient module and new RXJS module because the old ones were deprecated.
